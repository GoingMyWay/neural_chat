# ðŸ˜‡ TorchMoji

This module is heavily based on TorchMoji ([code](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji)) which is a [pyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the [DeepMoji](https://github.com/bfelbo/DeepMoji) model developped by Bjarke Felbo, Alan Mislove, Anders SÃ¸gaard, Iyad Rahwan and Sune Lehmann. Torchmoji has been implemented by the [huggingface company](https://huggingface.co/).
Here, we have added new API functions to more seamlessly interact with torhcmoji models.

This model trained on 1.2 billion tweets with emojis to understand how language is used to express emotions. Through transfer learning the model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on many emotion-related text modeling tasks.

Try the online demo of DeepMoji [http://deepmoji.mit.edu](http://deepmoji.mit.edu/)! See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00524), [blog post](https://medium.com/@bjarkefelbo/what-can-we-learn-from-emojis-6beb165a5ea0) or [FAQ](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/deepmoji/overview/) for more details.

## Overview
* [torchmoji/](torchmoji) contains all the underlying code needed to convert a dataset to the vocabulary and use the model.
* [examples/](examples) contains short code snippets showing how to convert a dataset to the vocabulary, load up the model and run it on that dataset.
* [scripts/](scripts) contains code for processing and analysing datasets to reproduce results in the paper.
* [model/](model) contains the pretrained model and vocabulary.
* [data/](data) contains raw and processed datasets that we include in this repository for testing.
* [tests/](tests) contains unit tests for the codebase.
* [api/](api) Our added scripts for interacting with torchmoji.

To start out with, have a look inside the [examples/](examples) directory. See [score_texts_emojis.py](examples/score_texts_emojis.py) for how to use DeepMoji to extract emoji predictions, [encode_texts.py](examples/encode_texts.py) for how to convert text into 2304-dimensional emotional feature vectors or [finetune_youtube_last.py](examples/finetune_youtube_last.py) for how to use the model for transfer learning on a new dataset.

Please consider citing the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00524) of DeepMoji if you use the model or code (see below for citation).

## Installation

We assume that you're using [Python 2.7-3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed.

First you need to install [pyTorch (version 0.2+)](http://pytorch.org/), currently by:
```bash
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
```
At the present stage the model can't make efficient use of CUDA. See details in the [Hugging Face blog post](https://medium.com/huggingface/understanding-emotions-from-keras-to-pytorch-3ccb61d5a983).

When pyTorch is installed, run the following in the root directory to install the remaining dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
This will install the following dependencies:
* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
* [text-unidecode](https://github.com/kmike/text-unidecode)
* [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji)

Then, run the download script to downloads the pretrained torchMoji weights (~85MB) from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8lax9ary32c7t9/pytorch_model.bin?dl=0) and put them in the model/ directory:

```bash
python scripts/download_weights.py
```

## Testing
To run the tests, install [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). After installing, navigate to the [tests/](tests) directory and run:

```bash
cd tests
nosetests -v
```

By default, this will also run finetuning tests. These tests train the model for one epoch and then check the resulting accuracy, which may take several minutes to finish. If you'd prefer to exclude those, run the following instead:

```bash
cd tests
nosetests -v -a '!slow'
```

## Disclaimer
This code has been tested to work with Python 2.7 and 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 and macOS Sierra machines. It has not been optimized for efficiency, but should be fast enough for most purposes. We do not give any guarantees that there are no bugs - use the code on your own responsibility!
